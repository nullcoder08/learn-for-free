# Programming And Software Development

This file contains resources to learn programming and software development. This file is divided into 2 parts - Goal-Oriented and General Purpose. 

1. Goal-Oriented resources teach you to deliver an output like making a website or an app. 
2. General Purpose resources teach you a particular language like Python or JavaScript and they also teach you about the general data structures which every programmer should know.

A Goal-Oriented listing has higher priority so if a resource falls in both general purpose and goal-oriented, it automatically goes in goal-oriented and is not duplicated.

**Goal-Oriented**

* [Android Development](#android-development)
* [Game Development](#game-development)
* [Web Development](#web-development)

**General Purpose**

* [Java](#java)
* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [Django](#django)
* [Python](#python)
* [Ruby](#ruby)
* [Data Structures](#DS)
